# Week 1 Code Challenge - Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions for the Week 1 code challenge, which includes three toy problems solved using Python.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Given a 12-hour time in the format of "hour:minute period", the function converts it to 24-hour time.

**Example:**
Input: "8:30 am"
Output: "0830"

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

The function takes three integers as arguments and returns True if exactly two of them are positive numbers, otherwise returns False.

**Example:**
Input: (2, 4, -3)
Output: True

### Challenge 3: Consonant value

Given a lowercase string with alphabetic characters, the function returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants have specific values assigned to them.

**Example:**
Input: "zodiacs"
Output: 26

## Project Structure

- `challenge1.py`: Contains the solution for Challenge 1.
- `challenge2.py`: Contains the solution for Challenge 2.
- `challenge3.py`: Contains the solution for Challenge 3.
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now!

## Usage

To test the solutions, you can import the functions from the respective modules and call them with appropriate inputs.

```python
from challenge1 import convert_to_24_hour
from challenge2 import are_two_positive
from challenge3 import solve_consonant_value

# Example usage
time_24_hour = convert_to_24_hour("8:30 am")
print(time_24_hour)  "

is_positive = are_two_positive(2, 4, -3)
print(is_positive) 

consonant_value = solve_consonant_value("zodiacs")
print(consonant_value)
